# Exercise 0: Example
#
# This is a practice exercise to familiarize you with basic Python data structures.
#
# Create a list called `example_list` and append three elements to it. Print each element using a loop.
#
# Requirements:
# - The list should contain any three elements of your choice.
# - Use a loop to print each element.

def example_list_function():
  example_list = ['element1', 'element2', 'element3']
  for element in example_list:
      print(element)

# Call the function and print each element
example_list_function()
print('--------------------------------------------------------------')

# Exercise 1: List and Indexing
#
# Create a list named students containing at least three student names (strings).
# Assign the second student’s name to a variable named first_student.
# Assign the last student’s name to a variable named last_student.

def manage_students():
  students = ['Zainab', 'Bayan', 'Sarah' , 'Noor']

  first_student = students[1]
  last_student= students[-1]

  return first_student , last_student

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 1:', manage_students())
print('--------------------------------------------------------------')

# Exercise 2: Loop and String Concatenation
#
# Create a tuple named foods containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the students list.
# Create a variable named meal and assign an empty string to it.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the strings in foods and append each string to meal.

def combine_foods():
  foods = ('Falafel', 'Shawarma', 'Pasta' , 'Pizza')
  meal = ''

  for food in foods:
    meal += food + ' '
    return meal

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 2:', combine_foods())
print('--------------------------------------------------------------')

# Exercise 3: Slicing Tuples
#
# Using the slice operator, assign a new tuple containing only the last two food strings in the foods to a variable named last_two_foods.

def slice_foods():
  foods = ('Falafel', 'Shawarma', 'Pasta' , 'Pizza')
  
  last_two_foods =  foods[len(foods) - 2], foods[len(foods) - 1]
  
  return last_two_foods

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 3:', slice_foods())
print('--------------------------------------------------------------')

# Exercise 4: Dictionaries and String Formatting
#
# Create a dictionary named home_town containing the keys of city, state, and population.
# Using the home_town dictionary, assign to a variable named home_town_message a string with this format: “I was born in <city>, <state> - population of <population>”

def hometown_info():
  home_town = {
    'city': 'Jidhafs',
    'state': 'Northern Governorate',
    'population': '711,442'
  }


  home_town_message = f"I was born in {home_town['city']}, {home_town['state']} - population of {home_town['population']}"

  return home_town_message

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 4:', hometown_info())
print('--------------------------------------------------------------')


# Exercise 5: Iterating Over Dictionary Items
#
# Define an empty list named home_town_items.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the key: value pairs in the home_town dictionary and append a string with the following format to home_town_items: "<key> = <value>"

def list_home_town_items():
  home_town = {
    'city': 'Jidhafs',
    'state': 'Northern Governorate',
    'population': '711,442'
  }

  home_town_items = []

  for key, value in home_town.items():
    home_town_items.append(f'{key} = {value}')

  return home_town_items
# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 5:', list_home_town_items())
print('--------------------------------------------------------------')
